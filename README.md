# Java Exercises Repository

This repository contains the Java exercises I completed during my studies at Senmon School. The exercises cover various topics and concepts in Java programming, including object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and more.

## Structure

Each exercise is organized into its own folder, with clear instructions and code solutions. The goal is to showcase the progress and understanding I gained throughout the course.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a portfolio of my Java programming skills and as a reference for future projects. It may also be helpful to other learners who are interested in exploring Java concepts.

## How to Use

Feel free to browse the exercises, review the code, and run the programs in your local environment. Constructive feedback is always welcome!
